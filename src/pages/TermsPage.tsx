Some capabilities are limited to certain regions, verification levels, or device types, and may be marked coming soon or beta until we announce general availability.",

    title: "8. Risk disclosure",
    content: [
      "Using the Services involves certain risks that you should understand:",
      "• NGN payment rails: Inbound bank transfers and Flutterwave-mediated payouts depend on the availability and accuracy of third-party banking infrastructure. Timing, settlement windows, and success of specific transfers may vary and are not fully within our control.",
      "• Stablecoin and on-chain settlement: Blockchain transactions are irreversible once confirmed. Stablecoin values, while designed to be stable, may deviate from their peg in extreme market conditions. On-chain data is publicly visible and permanent. Regulatory treatment of digital assets varies by jurisdiction and may change.",
      "• Device-based checkout (tap-to-pay, NFC): These flows depend on device hardware, operating system version, permissions granted by the user, and third-party certifications. Availability does not imply certification for every use case or compliance with every local standard.",
      "• Security: While we implement strong security controls, no system is perfectly secure. Unauthorized access to your account, device compromise, or social engineering attacks could result in loss of funds or data. You are responsible for securing the devices and credentials used with DayFi.",
      "• Regulatory and legal risk: The regulatory environment for payments, stablecoins, and digital financial services is evolving. Changes in law or regulation could affect the availability of specific features or the terms on which we can offer the Services.",
